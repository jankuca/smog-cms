# SmogCMS

This was a content management system I wrote in 2008 when I was learning programming. There was a lot of experimentation with PHP, dynamic module loading logic, templating logic, internationalization and other stuff. Most of the code is static OOP which is how a lot of PHP used to be written at that time. The CMS did not end up being used on a single project but it was a lot of fun to work on it.
